Before you can start you need:

* aspell: The actual spell checker.

  See <http://aspell.sourceforge.net/>.  I have used versions 0.32.5
  and 0.33.7.1.

* nsgmls: An SGML parser, part of the OpenJade package.

  See <http://openjade.sourceforge.net/>.  I have used versions 1.3
  and 1.3.1.  (Sometimes the executable is called onsgmls -- no
  difference.)

* sgmlspl: SGML processing tool for Perl.  Part of the SGMLS package.

  See <http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/SGMLS/>.  I have version
  1.03.  (Sometimes this package is known as perl-SGMLS.)

To install:

./configure --prefix=SOMEWHERE
gmake
gmake install

You need to use GNU make.

After installation, see the included man page sgml-spell-checker(1)
for usage information.
