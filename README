SGML spell-checking package
---------------------------
(formerly known as DocBook spell-checking package)

This package includes a couple of tools that you can use to
automatically spell-check your SGML documents.  One of the advantages
of this tool over some other SGML-aware spell checkers is that it
scans your documents in the form in which the SGML parser actually
sees it, which means it is not line-based, system entities are
resolved, marked sections are treated appropriately, etc.

Also, this tool can be made aware of particular DTDs, in the sense
that it knows not to spell-check the content of elements that do not
represent human-language text, such as <programlisting> in DocBook.
An exclusion list for the DocBook DTD is included, others can be added
trivially.

For installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.  After
installation see the included man page sgml-spell-checker(1) for usage
information.

If you like this or have comments, feel to write.
