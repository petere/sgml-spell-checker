Before you can start you need:

* aspell: the actual spell checker

  See <http://aspell.net/>.  I have used versions 0.33.7.1, 0.50.5, and
  0.60.  Support for versions before 0.50 will eventually be dropped.

* nsgmls: an SGML parser, part of the OpenJade package

  See <http://openjade.sourceforge.net/>.  I have used versions 1.3
  1.3.1, and 1.3.2.  (Sometimes the executable is called onsgmls -- no
  difference.)

* sgmlspl: SGML processing tool for Perl, part of the SGMLS package

  See <http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/SGMLS/>.  I have version
  1.03.  (Sometimes this package is known as perl-SGMLS.)

To install:

./configure --prefix=SOMEWHERE
gmake
gmake install

You need to use GNU make.

After installation, see the included man page sgml-spell-checker(1)
for usage information.
